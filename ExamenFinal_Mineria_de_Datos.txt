Examen final
1.	Pharmaceutical Industry.
An equities analyst is studying the pharmaceutical industry and would like your help in exploring and understanding the financial data collected by her firm. Her main objective is to understand the structure of the pharmaceutical industry using some basic financial measures.
Financial data gathered on 21 firms in the pharmaceutical industry are available in the file pharmaceuticals.csv. For each firm, the following variables are recorder:
a.	----
a.	Market capitalization (in billions of dollars)
b.	Beta
c.	Price/earnings ratio
d.	Return on equity
e.	Return on assets
f.	Asset turnover
g.	Leverage
h.	Estimated revenue growth
i.	Net profit margin
j.	Median recommendation (across major brokerages)
k.	Location of firm’s headquarters
l.	Stock exchange on which the firm is listed
Use cluster analysis to explore and analyse the given dataset as follows:
a.	Use only the numerical variables (1-9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify weights for different variables, the specific clustering analysis, such as the number of clusters formed, and so on.
b.	Interpret the clusters with respect to the categorical variables used in forming the clusters.
c.	Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10-12)? (those not used in forming the clusters).
d.	Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

2.	Recommending Courses.
We again consider the data in CourseTopics.csv describing course purchases at Statistics.com (see Problem 14.2 and data samples in Table14.14). We want to provide a course recommendation to a student who purchased the Regression and Forecast courses. Apply user-based collaborative filtering to the data. You will get a Null matrix. Explain why this happens.

3.	Satelite Radio Customers.
An analyst at a subscription-based satellite radio company has been given a sample of data from their customer database, with the goal of finding groups of customers who are associated with one another. The data consist of company data, together with purchased demographic data that are mapped to the company data (see Table 14.13). The analyst dacides to apply association rules to learn more about the associations between customers. Comment on this approach.
